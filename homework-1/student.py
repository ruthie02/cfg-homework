TASK 2

Write a base class to represent a student. Below is a starter code.
Feel free to add any more new features to your class.
As a minimum a student has a name and age and a unique ID.

Create a new subclass from student to represent a concrete student doing a specialization, for example:
Software Student and Data Science student.

class Student:

    def __init__(self, name, age, id):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.id = id
        self.subjects = dict()


# class CFGStudent(<should inherit from Student>)
#     create new methods that manage student's subects (add/remove new subject and its graade to the dict)
#     create a method to view all subjects taken by a student
#     create a method  (and a new variable) to get student's overall mark (use average)
