TASK 1

Write a class to represent a Cash Register.
You class should keep the state of price total and purchased items

Below is a starter code:
------------------------

2. you will NEED to add accepted method parameters where required.
For example, method add_item probably accepts some kind of an item?..
3. You will need to write some examples of how your code works.
